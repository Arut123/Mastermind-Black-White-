->In this game a word in random from the dictionary is chosen.
->You are told how many letters exist in the hidden word
->You enter a word with the same number of letters and try to get the hidden word
->For every word you enter no. of blacks and whites in that word is shown.
1)No. of blacks=No. of letters in ur word which exists in the hidden word but positions of the similar letters in ur word don't match with that of the hidden
2)No. of whites=No. of letters in you word existing in hidden word,and positions of similar letters are also same!
For example:
Lets take the hidden word to be 'Banana'
You enter the word 'Taught'
Now 'a' is common and positions match-Thus one white,zero blacks
Next you enter 'Leader'
Now 'a' is common again but positions differ-Thus one black,zero whites.
